# 8080 CPU Test Fixtures

## 8080EX1 — 8080 Instruction Exerciser

The `8080EX1.COM` binary is an exhaustive CPU exerciser for the Intel 8080,
based on the ZEXDOC exerciser for the Z80. It runs as a CP/M .COM program
and tests all documented 8080 instructions by computing CRC-32 checksums
against reference values from real hardware.
